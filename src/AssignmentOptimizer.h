/**********************************************************************************
*        File: AssignmentOptimizer.h
* Description: Call assignment based on a route simulation.
*              For every candidate cabin the route it is going to follow is simulated twice,
*              without and with the new call, using the very same stop-selection rule of the
*              real cabins (Floors::FindNextStop). The cost of a candidate is the extra passenger
*              time the new call causes: its own wait + ride, plus the delay it inflicts on
*              the passengers that were already assigned to that cabin.
*      Author: Emanuele Merlo (emanuele.merlo@gmail.com)
*       Notes: Pure functions (no access to the cabins): they are covered by tests/AssignmentOptimizerTests.cpp.
